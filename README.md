## Contributing

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. All contributions are welcome. But as a "gag" script, there's probably not much to do.

Additionally, I'm begging someone to address the green screen issue. It would look better if it was keyed out, but I dunno how to code that ;-; 
I would appreciate any contributions that can fix this shit lol
